    <h2>Intro to data</h2>
    <p>
        Data is information, and information is text, image and sound. So, data is a group of characters, colors, or frequencies. At least for human beings.

        For computers, data is a group of numbers. Numbers contained in the binary system, or in other words, zero and one.<br/>
        To communicate with computers, humans must map (convert) their data to the binary system.
