    <h1>Computer Science</h1>

    <h2>Intro to data</h2>
    <p>
        Data is information. Information is text, image and sound. In this way, data is a group of characters, colors, or frequencies.<br />
        That is how we, human beings, comprehend information. Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        For computers, data is a group of numbers. Numbers contained in the binary system.<br />
        The binary system is a universe of two different numbers, only. Zero and one.<br/>
        So, computers can only comprehend information translated to zeros and ones, to binary. <br />
        To communicate with computers, humans must translate (convert) their data into the binary system.
    </p>

    <h3>Converting data to binary</h3>
    <p>
        Well, let's start by converting numbers, as it looks more intuitive, since computers can only understand numbers. <br />
        We, humans, use the decimal system, a universe of ten different numbers: Zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight and nine.< br/>
        We can represent them respectively with the following symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.</br />
        By looking at the above sequence of symbols we can conclude computers can only read two of them: 0 and 1.<br />
        That leads us to our fundamental question.        
    </p>

    <h4>How to parse decimal to binary number?</h4>
    <p>
        The number 0 is easy to parse. 0 in decimal system is equals to 0 in the binary system.<br />
        We can apply the same rule for number 1. It is the same number in both systems.<br />
        This happens because the universe of decimal numbers is bigger than the universe of binary. So all the binary universe fit inside the decimal. Is it clear?<br />
